# Thesis - Point-of-Sale DNS Malware Simulator
Implements DNS exfiltration mechanisms of BernhardPOS, FrameworkPOS, MULTIGRAIN and UDPoS. Plain text exfiltration as added bonus.

This program consists of a `Client` that runs the simulated malware and `Server` that acts as authoritative DNS server for the configured domain and receives the exfiltrated information.

DNS exfiltration schedule and domains can be configured with the JSON files in the `configurations\` dir.

## ⚠️⚠️⚠️ WARNING ⚠️⚠️⚠️
The simulation is currently configured with **real** domains used in the respective campaigns per malware, so only run this in a confined setting with your own DNS server that is not connected to the internet.
