# Thesis - Point-of-Sale DNS Malware Simulator
Implements DNS exfiltration mechanisms of BernhardPOS, FrameworkPOS, MULTIGRAIN and UDPoS. Plain text exfiltration as added bonus.

This program consists of a `Client` that runs the simulated malware and `Server` that acts as authoritative DNS server for the configured domain and receives the exfiltrated information.
